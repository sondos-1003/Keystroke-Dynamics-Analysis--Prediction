# Keystroke-Dynamics-Analysis--Prediction
User Authentication based on Keystroke Dynamics Biometrics.
Keystroke dynamics basically deals with the analysis of keystroke patterns of a user. In one of its use cases, 
this can essentially enable companies to provide non-intrusive real-time authentication of users.

By capturing the duration between 2 key presses, the duration of pressing down a key,
and the duration between the current key release and the next key press can provide great insights about the user. The next time this user logs in,
by comparing his current typing pattern with his previous typing patterns, 
companies can authenticate whether the logged in user is legitimate or fraudulent.

Used Various types of Detectors
detectors that used (Gaussian Mixture Models/Manhattan Filtered Detector (MFD) ) for our purpose and try to understand how differently they perform 
the training and the testing.
